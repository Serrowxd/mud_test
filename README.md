Literally just throwing ideas at the wall idk

This runs locally in the command line

`npm run bench`

Currently working on adding an HTML GUI that will visualize the data.

**Notes**

Happy place for my notes.

I'm heavily considering adding Jquery, though currently I don't have a use for it. I might in the future, for the time being I'll hold it on secondary until I end up wanting to run it. This is the slim/min version, so I'll make sure to include the non-slim version in the future if I decide to stick with it for Ajax calls.

The next few commits past this point will likely be UI based, I need to get something put up on screen that the user can see and interact with, and I think once I have a visual representation of what the user will be seeing/using it'll be easier for me.

Data persistence is future dated, but I'm not intending for this to be anything long-term currently, so a back-end server isn't being considered until the logic is all in play - in which case I will move the front-end data manipulation into back-end so I can route the majority of the logic through the server.

I didn't expect to make it this far with a test bench, but here we are!
